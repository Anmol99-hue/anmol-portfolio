# GTA Traffic Risk Dashboard

You’ll see how I simulate representative GTA data, model incident risk, and turn it into a dashboard for **autonomous vehicle testing**.

## Context
Solo build, 2025. Time-boxed MVP for portfolio. Goal: surface **actionable** hotspots, not just pretty charts.

## Data
- Simulated collisions, speeds, congestion, weather, road class.
- Aggregated to grid tiles (H3 style) and corridors.

## Approach
- Feature engineering (hour-of-week, weather bins, speed deltas).
- Baselines vs. simple ML (logit / XGBoost) for risk score.
- Power BI mock for stakeholders; Next.js page for web.

## Results & Impact
- Example: *Top 10 tiles* show 20–35% higher predicted collisions vs city average.
- Demo filters: day/night, weather, corridor.
